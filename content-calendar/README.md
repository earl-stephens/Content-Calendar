## Introduction

This is a simple Spring application, based on a tutorial from Dan Vega.  The tutorial is located at [Spring Boot Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgX5lgv4uVM)

The course starts with some explanation of the different parts of Spring.  It then uses Spring Boot to spin up a project.  The project uses an H2 in memory database.  Postman is used to make calls to the app (which runs locally on an Apache Tomcat server).

## Further Improvements

TDD was not used for the development of this app.  I would like to add that in in the future.

## Built With

OpenJDK 17.0.6
